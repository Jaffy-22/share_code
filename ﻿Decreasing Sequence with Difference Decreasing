/*Question
﻿Decreasing Sequence with Difference Decreasing
Two integers N and D are passed as input. The program must print the decreasing sequence from N with common difference D. The difference D is decremented by 1 when calculating the values every time. The sequence is printed until D becomes zero.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 9999999
1 <= D <= 9999999
Input Format:
The first line contains N and D separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains integers separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
205
Output:
15 11 8 65
﻿Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
126
Output:
61-3 -6 -8 -9
