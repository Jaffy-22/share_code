/*Question:
Average Speed
A single line L with a set of space separated values indicating distance travelled and time taken is passed as the input. The program must calculate the average speed S (with precision upto 2 decimal places) and print S as the output.
Note: The distance and time taken will follow the format
DISTANCE@TIMETAKEN. DISTANCE will
be in kilometers and TIMETAKEN will be in hours.
Input Format:
The first line contains L.
Output Format:
The first line contains the average speed
S.
Boundary Conditions:
Length of L will be from 3 to 100.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
60@2 120@3
Output: 36.00 kmph
Explanation:
Total distance = 60+120 = 180 km.
Total time taken = 2+3 = 5 hours. Hence average speed = 180/5 = 36.00 kmph
