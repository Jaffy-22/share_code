/*Question:
Alternate Repeat Pattern
The program must accept a positive even integer N as the input. The program must print the desired pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output section.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= N <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains the positive even integer N.
Output Format:
The lines containing the desired pattern as shown in the Example Input/Output section.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6
Output: 
1666666
2255555
3334444
Example Input/Output 2: Input:
4
Output: 14444
22333

//Solution
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
int n,n1;
scanf("%d",&n);
n1=n;//if we didn't declare n1 while decrementing if we decrement n then in loop also n value will be changed
for(int i=1;i<=n/2;i++)//n/2 from the given o/p it is obsered the no of rows is half of the given number and column is n+1 as per o/p
{
    for(int j=1;j<=n+1;j++)
    {
        if(i==j || j<=i)//the value 1,2...are printed until i and j are equal and the before values are also same so so the col must be less than rows
        {
            printf("%d",i);
        }
        else
        {
            printf("%d",n1);
        }
    }
    n1--;
    printf("\n");
}
}
