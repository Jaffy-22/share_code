/*Question
﻿Count of common factors
Given a set of numbers where all other numbers are multiple of the smallest number, the program must find the count of the common factors C excluding 1.
Input Format:
First line will contain the integer value N representing how many numbers are passed as input.
Next N lines will have the numbers.
Output Format:
First line will contain the count of
common factors C.
Constraints:
N will be from 2 to 20.
Sample Input/Output:
Example 1:
Input:
2
100
75
Output:
2
﻿Explanation:
The common factors excluding 1 are 5,25. Hence output is 2
Example 2: Input:
3
10
20
30
Output:
3
Explanation:
The common factors excluding 1 are 2,5,10. Hence output is 3.
