/*Question:
A certain number of people attended a meeting which was to begin at 10:00 am on a given day. The arrival time in HH:MM format of those who attended the meeting is passed as the input in a single line, with each arrival time by a space. The program must print the count of people who came late (after 10:00 am) to the meeting.
Input Format:
The first line contains the arrival time separated by a space.
Output Format:
The first line contains the count of late comers.
Boundary Conditions:
The length of the input string is between 4 to 10000.
The time HH:MM will be in 24 hour format (HH is hours and MM is minutes).
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10:00 9:55 10:02 9:45 11:00
Output: 2
Explanation:
The 2 people were those who came at 10:02 and 11:00

//Solution:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
    char s[100001];
    int c = 0;
    while (scanf("%s", s) == 1) //loop to read input (HH:MM times) until no more valid input is available.
    {
        int h, m;
        sscanf(s, "%d:%d", &h, &m);// the sscanf function is used to extract hours and minutes from the input time string and then calculates the total time in minutes
        if (h > 10 || (h == 10 && m > 0)) //checks whether the time is after 10:00 am, considering both hours and minutes. If the hours are greater than 10, it's obviously after 10:00 am.
                                          //If the hours are exactly 10 and the minutes are greater than 0, it's still after 10:00 am. 
        {
            c++;
        }
    }
    printf("%d", c);

    return 0;
}
