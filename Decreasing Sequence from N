/*Question:
Decreasing Sequence from N
Two integers N and D are passed as input. The program must print the decreasing sequence from N to 1 with common difference D.
Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= N <= 9999999
1 <= D <= 9999999
Input Format:
The first line contains N and D separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains integers separated by a space.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
20 3
Output:
17 14 11 8 5 2
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
265
Output:
21 16 11 6 1
