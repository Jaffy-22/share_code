/*Question
Arithmetic Progression - Nth Term
The first three terms in an arithmetic progression are passed as input. A positive integer value N (where N > 3) is also passed as the input. The program must print Nth term in the arithmetic progression.
Input Format:
The first line will contain the first three
terms separated by a space.
The second line will contain N.
Output Format:
The integer value denoting the Nth term.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5 10 15
6
Output: 30
Explanation:
The progression is 5 10 15 20 25 30 35
and so on.
The 6th term is 30.
