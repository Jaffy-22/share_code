Output Format:
The first line contains the name of the car with the lowest mileage.
Boundary Conditions:
The length of the input string is between 4 to 10000.
The length of the car name is from 1 to 50.

//Solution
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<string.h>  // Include this header for using strcpy function
int main()
{
    char s[100001];
    float least = 9999999999; // Initialize to a large value
    char name[101];
    
    while (scanf("%s", s) == 1)
    {
        char cname[101];
        float mil;
        sscanf(s, "%[^@]@%f", cname, &mil);
        if (mil < least)
        {
            least = mil;
            strcpy(name, cname);// copy the characters from cname to name, ensuring that the content is correctly copied and stored in the name variable.
        }
    }
    
    printf("%s", name);
    
    return 0;
