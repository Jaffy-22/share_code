In a betting game involving the roll of a dice, Sandeep gains Rs.X if an odd number turns up and he loses Rs.Y is an even number turns up. The numbers shown on the face of the dice in a certain number of games is passed as input. The values of X and Y are also passed as input. The program must print the net gain or loss as the output.
Input Format:
First line will contain the numbers shown on the face of the dice separated by one or more spaces.
Second line will contain the value of X
Third line will contain the value of Y
Output Format:
The net gain or loss (loss will be a negative value)
Sample Input/Output:
Example 1:
Input:
1 4 3
10
30

Solution
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
int arr[10],x,y,tot=0;
int i=0;
while(scanf("%d",&arr[i])>0)//The while loop will even get the value of x and y and store it
{
    i++;
}
int c=sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);//c is the size of the array got from the user
//since the i/p will be taking the dices faces first then x and then y
x=arr[i-2];
y=arr[i-1];
for(int j=0;j<i-2;j++)
{
    if(arr[j]%2==0)
    tot-=y;//if arr[j] is even then there will be loss
    else
    tot+=x;//if arr[j] is odd then there will be profit
}
printf("%d",tot);
}
