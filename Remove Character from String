/*Question:
Remove Character from String
The program must accept a string $ and a character CH as the input. The program must remove all the occurrences of CH in the string S and print it as the output.
Boundary Condition(s):
2 <= Length of S <= 100
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: icecream
C
Output: ieream
Explanation:
The character has occurred 2 times in the string "i e ream". So they are removed from the
string and printed as the output.
Example Input/Output 2: Input:
greatappleshouldbeanapple
P
Output:
greataleshouldbeanale

#include <stdio.h>

        {
        if (s[i] != c) {
            s[j++] = s[i];
        }
/*In the expression s[j++], the value of j is used before being incremented by 1.
For instance, if j is initially 0, s[j++] accesses s[0] and then increments j to 1.
This accesses the first character of the string and advances j to the next position.*/
