/*Question:
Space Separated Integers Sum
A single line consisting of a set of integers, each separated by space is passed as input to the program. The program must print the sum of all the integers present.
Input Format:
The first line contains the integer values (Each separated by a space)
Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of all the integers.
Boundary Conditions:
The length of the input string is between 3 to 10000
The value of the integer values will be from -99999 to 99999
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
100 -99 98 5
Output:
104
Example Input/Output 2: Input:
100 200-300 500-450 -50
Output:
0
*/
//Solution:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main()
{
int sum=0;
char s[10001];
while(scanf("%s",s)==1)//The loop continues as long as the conversion is successful (returns 1), implying that valid input is being read.
{
    int num=atoi(s);//the atoi function from the <stdlib.h> library to convert a string to an integer.
    sum+=num;
}
printf("%d",sum);
}
